# Human-Emotions
  This model uses deep learning to analyse the emotions of the person. The emotions are in seven catergories - Happy, Sad, 
  Disgusted, Surprised, Neutral, Fearful and Angry. `Emotion.py` can be launched to start the project. The screen view shows
  detected faces, their detected emotion and the probabilities of other emotions too.
  Webcam or any other camera, along with Python is mandatory for the 
  project to work.
  
  The screen view can be closed via `Esc`, `Q` or the Close button.
  
  More information on the model is available [here](Model/README.md).
